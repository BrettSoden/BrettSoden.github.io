# **CS-499 ePortfolio**



## **Introduction**
    Hello my name is Brett Soden, and I started attending SNHU's computer science program in July, 
    2019. This gitHub pages account is meant to provide an electronic portfolio from which I finish
    my final project for CS-499 and compelete my Bachelor's degree in computer science.  


## **Education Review**
    Compeleting my coursework for this class has led me to appreciate the importance of reviewing 
    and polishing one's work in a professional manner.  This review process can often include 
    removing and rewriting unnecessarily complicated code, adding comments, and increasing a program's 
    capabilities.  During the course of this class, I have enhanced my artifacts through the addition 
    of testing modules for secure coding, new functions for database CRUD funcitonality, and increased
    complexity in list search function for an appointment scheduler. 


## **Artifacts**
   The artifacts presented for the portfolio are introductions to my work for software design and 
   engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.  Through the course of the class, I 
   have improved my artifacts software, expanded their complexity, and added comments to make their code
   easier to read.
