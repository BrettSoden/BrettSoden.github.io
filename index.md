# **CS-499 ePortfolio**



## **Introduction**
   Hello my name is Brett Soden, and I started attending SNHU's computer science program in July, 
   2019. This gitHub pages account is meant to provide an electronic portfolio from which I finish
   my final project for CS-499 and compelete my Bachelor's degree in computer science.  


## **Education Review**
   Compeleting my coursework for this class has led me to appreciate the importance of reviewing 
   and polishing one's work in a professional manner.  This review process can often include 
   removing and rewriting unnecessarily complicated code, adding comments, and increasing a program's     
   capabilities.  During the course of this class, I have enhanced my artifacts through the addition 
   of testing modules for secure coding, new functions for database CRUD funcitonality, and increased
   complexity in list search function for an appointment scheduler. 
   
   Collaborating in a team environment has also allowed me to gain an appreciation for the ability to 
   have a new pair of eyes review my work.  Often I can get too close to a project, and lose the ability
   to look at my work objectively, but having another reviewer can reveal previously unseen mistakes
   and advice for possible improvements.  Additionally the ability to communicate with stakeholders and
   and discover what they want in a project, has been a focus of my work in this class and has reinforced 
   my belief that the most important part of the software development lifecycle is when the requirements
   for the project are being decided on during discussion with stakeholder, programmers, project leads,
   and end users.


## **Artifacts**
   The artifacts presented for the portfolio are introductions to my work for software design and 
   engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.  Through the course of the class, I 
   have improved my artifacts software, expanded their complexity, and added comments to make their code
   easier to read.
